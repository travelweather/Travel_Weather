Inspiration:
The end of the Covid-19 pandemic is near and soon people will begin to freely travel around the world again. With countries starting to loosen Covid-19 restrictions and beginning to open their doors to tourists we thought it was fitting to assist travelers in planning their journeys.

What it does:
Our application provides quick and easy information about the weather conditions at the cities the user is going to travel to. Given the start and end dates of the vacation, our program displays a summary of the weather conditions for each day. This information helps the user plan their trip better so there are no unexpected issues.

How we built it:
We built this project using python and the python libraries tkinter, tkcalendar and requests. To obtain the weather information we used a weather API called Timeline Weather API. The IDE we used was PyCharm and we worked together through Code With Me.

Challenges we ran into:
Since this was our very first hackathon, we did not know what to expect. Most of our challenges were keeping up with the 48 hour deadline and deciding a theme for our project very late into the first day. We initially started with a python web application using Visual Studio, but immediately ran into problems since we are inexperienced programmers. After deciding to work with PyCharm, it was much easier but we started having trouble with the API. After many more hours of research we overcame these issues and had a successful python program.

Accomplishments that we're proud of:
Since this was our very first python application using an API and our very first hackathon, weâ€™re very proud of the work we have accomplished together.

What we learned:
We learned how to efficiently use our time during the hackathon, use APIs, and create a python application. We also learned to work together to have a successful final product.
